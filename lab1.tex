\section*{Introduction}
When we perform most scientific experiments, , we have to perform multiple measurements of a certain quantity to obtain a more accurate value.  In this case, we need to be able to calculate the error of the average of these measurements so that we can treat it as a single, more accurate measurement.\\

Suppose that $x$ is a random variable with a standard deviation of $\sigma$, and ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}$ are $n$ random values of $x$.  Then, as we are adding a total of $n$ terms to find the variance, the variance of the sum of all $n$ x-values must be $n\sigma^2$.  As the variance is the sum of squared terms, if we divide each term by $n$, the variance must be divided by $n^2$.  Since the total divided by n equals the sample mean, the variance of the sample mean, $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$, must be equal to $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$.  By taking the square root of the variance of the sample mean, we get the standard error of $\bar{x}$, as shown in equation (1).
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation}\\

Additionally, in most scientific experiments, we need to determine how the errors for each measurement influence the final result.  To do this, it is necessary to use the propagation of error formula.  Suppose that \{$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$\} is a set of $n$ measurements, with errors of \{$\delta x_1, \delta x_2, \ldots, \delta x_n$\}, and we want to find the error in the value of a quantity $q$, which is a function of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.  Then, the error contributed to $q$ from \{$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$\} is found exactly by equation (2) and quickly estimated by equation (3).
\begin{equation}
	\delta q=\sqrt{(\frac{\partial q}{\partial x_1}\delta x_1)^2+(\frac{\partial q}{\partial x_2}\delta x_2)^2+\ldots+(\frac{\partial q}{\partial x_n}\delta x_n)^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\delta q \leq |\frac{\partial q}{\partial x_1}\delta x_1|+|\frac{\partial q}{\partial x_2}\delta x_2|+\ldots + |\frac{\partial q}{\partial x_n}\delta x_n|
\end{equation}
